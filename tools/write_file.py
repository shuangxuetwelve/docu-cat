"""
File writing tool for the AI agent.

This module provides a LangChain tool that allows the agent to write
or update file contents in the repository. This is essential for the agent to:
- Update documentation files (README.md, TOOLS.md, etc.)
- Create new documentation when needed
- Apply fixes or updates to existing files

The tool includes safety checks and error handling for write operations.
