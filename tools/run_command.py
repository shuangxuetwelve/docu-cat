"""
Command execution tool for the AI agent.

This module provides a LangChain tool that allows the agent to execute
shell commands within a repository. This is essential for the agent to:
- Inspect file contents (e.g., cat, head, tail)
- Check git diffs to understand code changes
- Run git commands to analyze commit history
- Execute other commands needed to understand repository context

The tool is designed with safety features including timeouts and error handling
to prevent runaway commands from affecting the system.
